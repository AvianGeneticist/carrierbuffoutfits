# carrierbuffoutfits
 A plugin that adds several carrier-enhancing outfits to Naev:
 
 - Blitz AIs focus on massive deploy speed boosts and damage, making ambush tactics much stronger.
 - Recon AIs focus on damage and move speed, allowing drones to quickly strike their targets.
 - Brawler AIs focus on damage and armor bonuses, making each individual fighter far sturdier.
 - Mass AIs trade individual fighter stats for greatly increased bay capacities.
 - Upgrade AIs give increases to damage, armor, and mobility, but are expensive to run and make fighter reload times longer.
